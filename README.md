*Feature Collection from 3D structures (34 features)
 
1.Pocket profile (PP)

Fpocket(https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-168)  was used to determine whether or not amino acids are located in detectable binding pockets, and only those cysteines located in pockets were retained. Druggability, hydrophobicity, and polarity were collected. 

Depth (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/41/W1/W314/1111943?login=false) was used to calculate the depth of cysteine burial.

2. SASA-PKA profile (SPP)

The pKa and SASA values for each cysteine and its surrounding amino acids within 4, 6, 8, and 10 Å of cysteine were calculated using PROPKA 3 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26596171/) and freeSASA (https://freesasa.github.io/), respectively. 

3.Amino Acid Composition (AAC)

Total number of surrounding amino acid residues within 4, 6, 8, and 10 Å of cysteine was calculated, and also the respective number of polar and hydrophobic amino acids according to the hydrophobic/polar (H/P) classification by Kamtekar et al. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8259512/). 
Canonical H/P patterning: ADEGHKNPQRST-CFILMVWY

**Feature Collection from sequences (46 features), including 
20 PSSMs
1 monograms 
20 bigrams
1 PSEE
1 Helix probability
1 Beta-Strand probability
1 Coil probability
1 ASA
HyperCys utilizes DisPredict2 to extract sequence features.
DisPredict_v2.0 (http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software.html)
we need: 
1) Column 10 - 29: 20 PSSMs
					- generate with PSI-BLAST and normalize using 9.0	
										
2) Column 30 - 32: 3 secondary structure (helix, strand and coil) probabilities
					- generate using SPINE X
					
3) Column 33: 1 accessible surface area
				- generate using SPINE X
					

4) Column 36 - 56: 1 monogram and 20 bigrams
				- generate using source code provided with DisPredict supplementary materials
				- available at SuppMaterial_DisPredict/Software/Source Codes
				- guidelines to execute it is described in "Steps to prediction" below
				- normalize the values with exponent (6.0)

5) Column 57: 1 Position Specific Estimated Energy (PSEE)
