Prerequisite
============

1) PSI-BLAST with NR database (from NCBI toolkit) 
Availability > ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/
Output > PSSM

2) SPINE X 
Availability > http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu/SPINE-X/

Output > secondary strucutre probabilities (helix, strand and coil)
		 accessible surface area and 
		 torsion angles (phi and psi) 
		 
3) IUPred
Availability > http://iupred.enzim.hu/
Output > prediction of intrinsically unstructured protein 
Note: 
	> The output (short disorder) is used for DAVAR -> phi, psi backbone torsion angle fluctuations prediction
	> This output is NOT used for DisPredict	

4) DAVAR (Install in 'AdditionalFiles' directory of Software)
Reference: 
	> E. Faraggi et al., ``Improving the prediction accuracy of residue solvent 
	accessibility and real-value backbone torsion angles of proteins by fast guided-
	learning through a two-layer neural network.'', Proteins 74, 857-871 (2009)
	> contact @'yaoqi.zhou@griffith.edu.au' for the software
	
4) libSVM


5) GCC
Availability > http://gcc.gnu.org/
The source codes are written in C/C++. To compile and execute, GCC is needed.
