1.Pocket profile (PP)

Fpocket(https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-168)  was used to determine whether or not amino acids are located in detectable binding pockets, and only those cysteines located in pockets were retained. Druggability, hydrophobicity, and polarity were collected. 

Depth (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/41/W1/W314/1111943?login=false) was used to calculate the depth of cysteine burial.

2. SASA-PKA profile (SPP)

The pKa and SASA values for each cysteine and its surrounding amino acids within 4, 6, 8, and 10 Å of cysteine were calculated using PROPKA 3 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26596171/) and freeSASA (https://freesasa.github.io/), respectively. 

3.Amino Acid Composition (AAC)

Total number of surrounding amino acid residues within 4, 6, 8, and 10 Å of cysteine was calculated by PyMOL (Schrödinger LLC, USA), and also the respective number of polar and hydrophobic amino acids according to the hydrophobic/polar (H/P) classification by Kamtekar et al. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8259512/).
